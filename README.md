Welcome! This project is a mobile GPS, made with Android Studio and using purely Java for its development. It consists on an app that shows your initial position and current position, by telling the latitude, longitude and angle you are located. It also calculates the distance between both, in meters. It's destined for Android 7.1.1 Nougat users, but it works on other Android versions too.
